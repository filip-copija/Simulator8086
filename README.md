# Intel-8086-Simulator / school-project

Basic elements of microprocessor work
## Description
The main goal of my project was to get acquainted with the work of Intel processor. I learned some basics of HTML, CSS and JS,
which ultimately led to creation of simple web page. Intel 8086 Simulator allows you to generate random values of base registers and 
perform MOV and XCHG instructions.
